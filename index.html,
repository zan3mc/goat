        <h1 class="heading">What Did Amelia Do?</h1>
        <p class="work">Amelia is most known for many early aviation records, including being the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. But she wasn’t always a pilot. It all started on a Christmas visit in 1917 to her sister in Toronto, Canada. While there she witnessed injured soldiers returning from World War I. After training to be a nurse’s aide at the Red Cross, she began working with the Voluntary Aid Detachment at Spadina Military Hospital. While working with the wounded soldiers she would hear stories from military pilots, sparking an interest in flying. After going through illness in 1918 she enrolled in medical studies at Columbia University, quitting her studies a year later and moving back to California with her parents. Earhart would get her pilot license May 16th, 1923. After obtaining her pilot license Amelia would go on to be the first woman to make a nonstop solo flight across the United States in 1932, setting the transcontinental record to 19 hours (LA to Newark) in 1932. She would break this record less than a year later by making the same flight in 17 hours and 7 minutes. In 1935 she became the first person to fly solo from Honolulu, Hawaii, to Oakland, California (the U.S. mainland). In 1935 Earhart set the speed record between Mexico City and Washington, D.C.  Finally becoming the first person to fly solo from Mexico City to Newark. New Jersey in the same year.</p>
